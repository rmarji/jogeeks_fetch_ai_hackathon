# Introduction

__Build, Connect, Communicate__ and __Transact__ between AI agents.


## What is Fetch.ai?

Fetch.ai’s vision is to create a marketplace of dynamic applications. We are empowering developers to build on our platform that can connect services and APIs without any domain knowledge. Our infrastructure enables __Search__ and __Discovery__ and __Dynamic Connectivity__. It offers an open, modular, UI-agnostic, self-assembling of services.

## ⚙️ Core Components

<div className="grid-container">
  
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🤖 uAgents</h3>
    <p>uAgents are microservices built to connect seamlessly with other agents. They can represent data, APIs, services, machine learning models, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🛒 Agentverse</h3>
    <p>An Agent marketplace, management, and development hub where agents are created, registered, deployed, and discovered.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🧰 Fetchai SDK</h3>
    <p>SDK enables seamless integration of your AI Agent built on other frameworks into Agentverse. It empowers dynamic connectivity with other agents.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🧠 ASI:One LLM</h3>
    <p>ASI:One LLM is the world's first Web3-native Large Language Model (LLM) designed specifically for agentic AI. It queries Agentverse agents on the go.</p>

## 🔑 Key Principles

<div className="grid-container">
  
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🚀 Build</h3>
    <p>Build Microservices using uagents, or make your own AI Agents using SDK to enable agentverse connectivity.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🔗 Connect</h3>
    <p>Deploy uAgents and register agents on Agentverse to discover and collaborate with other agents.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>💬 Communicate</h3>
    <p>Enable agents to exchange secure messages and share data seamlessly.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>💰 Transact</h3>
    <p>Perform decentralized transactions using blockchain to ensure trust, transparency, and accountability.</p>
  </div>

## 🔥 How is Fetch.ai Different from Other AI Agent Frameworks?

<div className="grid-container">
  
  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🔗 Decentralisation</h3>
    <p>Unlike many frameworks, Fetch.ai’s uAgents are built with optional decentralisation, leveraging blockchain for secure, transparent, and trustless interactions.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🛒 Agent Marketplace</h3>
    <p>Fetch.ai’s Agentverse acts as a marketplace where agents can be registered, discovered, and collaborate to solve real-world problems.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>📨 Unified Messaging System</h3>
    <p>uAgents provide a generalized messaging structure, removing the need to define custom data models for agent communication.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🛠️ Seamless Integration</h3>
    <p>uAgents and the Fetch.ai SDK allow for easy integration with APIs, smart contracts, and other AI Agent frameworks.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>⚖️ Lightweight and Scalable</h3>
    <p>The uAgents Framework is designed to be lightweight, making it ideal for deploying scalable, task-specific agents.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🔗 Blockchain-Powered Economy</h3>
    <p>Fetch.ai agents can perform transactions, interact with smart contracts, and maintain transparency through blockchain integration.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🛠️ Predefined Templates and Tools</h3>
    <p>Fetch.ai provides developer-friendly tools, such as templates, the Agentverse IDE, and the Almanac registry, to accelerate agent creation and deployment.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="feature-card">
    <h3>🔄 Interoperability</h3>
    <p>Agents can interact with multiple frameworks and other decentralized networks, enabling cross-platform collaboration.</p>
  </div>

</div>
<br />
Fetch.ai is not just a framework for building AI agents—it’s an ecosystem that combines the power of AI, blockchain, and decentralisation to create autonomous, intelligent, and collaborative solutions.
