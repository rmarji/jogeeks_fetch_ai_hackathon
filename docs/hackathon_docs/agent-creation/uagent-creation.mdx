# Build and understand uAgents

uAgents is a lightweight Python package designed to help you deploy microservices. These microservices can then be utilized by your AI agents as tools for executing tasks and achieving defined objectives.

## Installing uAgents framework

Fetch.ai's [uAgents Framework](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) package is a Python library running on Ubuntu/Debian, macOS, and Windows systems.

On your computer, you may need to install:

    - [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - Python package manager.
    - [uAgents](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) library

### Install with Pip

1. Create a directory :

```
mkdir my_agents_project
cd my_agents_project
```

2. Initialize and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

3. Install Fetch.ai uagents library:

```
pip install uagents
```

4. Verify the installation:

```
pip show uagents
```

## Create your first uAgent

Once you've installed the uAgents library, it's quite simple to get a minimal use case running.

### The uAgent

1. Create a Python script:

```
touch my_first_agent.py
```

2. Import the necessary classes and instantiate your agent:

``` python
from uagents import Agent, Context

# instantiate agent
agent = Agent(
    name="alice",
    seed="secret_seed_phrase",
    port=8000,
    endpoint=["http://localhost:8000/submit"]
)

# startup handler
@agent.on_event("startup")
async def startup_function(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

    - __Agent parameters__:

        - `name`: Identifies the agent (here, “alice”).
        - `seed`: Sets a deterministic seed, generating fixed addresses each time.
        - `port` and `endpoint`: Configure where the agent will be available.

    - __Behavior on startup__:

        The `@agent.on_event("startup")` decorator sets a function that runs as soon as the agent launches. In this sample, the agent logs a message including its name and unique address.

### Run your agent

With your virtual environment activated, run the script:

```
python my_first_agent.py
```

#### Sample output

```
INFO:     [alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
INFO:     [alice]: Agent inspector available at https://Agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1q...
INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     [alice]: Hello, I'm agent alice and my address is agent1q...
```

## Ways to create uAgents

There are three main ways to create and deploy uAgents, each suited to different needs:

    1. Hosted Agents
    2. Local Agents
    3. Mailbox Agents

Understanding these options will help you choose the best setup.

### Hosted Agents

You can create and host agents directly on [Agentverse](https://Agentverse.ai/):

1. Navigate to Agentverse → Agents tab → + New Agent.

![new-agent](/img/uagents/new-agent.png)

2. Choose Blank Agent or Skeleton Agent.

    - From a Blank Agent - You have to code everything.
    - From a Skeleton Agent - You will get one data model with one decorator each.

    choose __Blank Agent__.

![blank-agent](/img/uagents/blank-agent.png)

3. Provide a name for your new Agent.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/resources/img/uagents/blank-agent-name.png" alt="tech-stack" style={{ width: '75%', maxWidth: '600px' }} />
</div>


4. After creation, click on the __agent__ and then __Build__ tab to open the embedded code editor.

![blank-agent-created](/img/uagents/blank-agent-created.png)

5. Add your Python code (similar to the first_agent.py example).

![blank-agent-code-start](/img/uagents/blank-agent-code-start.png)

6. Click __Start__ to run the agent; logs appear in the __terminal__ below the editor.

:::note
**Note:** Hosted Agents support the full Python built-in library and specific third-party packages (like `uagents`, `requests`, `openai`, etc.). However, some libraries are restricted for security reasons. If you need additional packages, consider using **Mailbox Agents**.
:::

#### Supported Libraries on Agentverse:

The Agentverse now provides full Python support! This means that all Hosted Agents will now support the full Python built-in library plus the following packages:

import React from 'react';

<style>
{`
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .grid-item {
    padding: 8px;
    background: #f9f9f9;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    text-align: center;
  }
`}
</style>

<div className="grid-container">
  <div className="grid-item">uagents</div>
  <div className="grid-item">requests</div>
  <div className="grid-item">cosmpy</div>
  <div className="grid-item">pydantic</div>
  <div className="grid-item">uagents-ai-engine</div>
  <div className="grid-item">MySQLdb</div>

  <div className="grid-item">pymongo</div>
  <div className="grid-item">bs64</div>
  <div className="grid-item">faiss-cpu</div>
  <div className="grid-item">fetchai-babble</div>
  <div className="grid-item">google-generativeai</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-anthropic</div>

  <div className="grid-item">langchain-community</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-core</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-google-genai</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-google-vertexai</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-openai</div>
  <div className="grid-item">langchain-text-splitters</div>

  <div className="grid-item">langchain</div>
  <div className="grid-item">nltk</div>
  <div className="grid-item">openai</div>
  <div className="grid-item">tenacity</div>
  <div className="grid-item">unstructured</div>
  <div className="grid-item">validators</div>
</div>

<br />
Once you run an hosted agent, you don't have to bother about it's uptime. It will be always running.

### Local Agents

Local Agents run entirely on your own machine or server, just like the example in `my_first_agent.py`. These agents:

    - Have complete freedom to import any Python library or custom modules.
    - Can handle events, messages, and tasks continuously.
    - Are registered on the Almanac contract, allowing them to communicate with other local agents.
    - Require you to manage uptime, environment dependencies, and scaling if necessary.

:::note
**Use Case:** Ideal for tasks requiring advanced customization, local file access, or extensive machine learning libraries.
:::

### Mailbox Agents

When you need to use libraries not allowed by the hosted environment, or you want direct local control while also integrating with Agentverse, you can set up a Mailbox Agent.

A Mailbox Agent runs locally but connects to the Agentverse via a secure channel, enabling interaction with other hosted or local agents. To configure this: 

1. Lets setup a local agent first like we did in the section [here](#the-uagent) but include `mailbox=True`.

```py title="mailbox_agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
 
class Message(Model):
    message: str
 
SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"
 
# Now your agent is ready to join the Agentverse!
agent = Agent(
    name="alice",
    port=8000,
    mailbox=True        
)
 
# Copy the address shown below
print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

2. Run the Script

You should get something similar within your terminal output:

```
INFO:     [Alice]: Starting agent with address: agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx
INFO:     [Alice]: Agent inspector available at https://Agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1q0nrj45ah0e53424n9uqc83d9xxs6534jug7j6ka4z6wnrsx7ex2kwx86t4
INFO:     [Alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     [Alice]: Starting mailbox client for https://Agentverse.ai
INFO:     [Alice]: Mailbox access token acquired
INFO:     [Alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
```

#### Create a Mailbox in Agentverse

Now that we defined our local Agent and have successfully run it, we can go on and connect it to [Agentverse](https://Agentverse.ai/) via a Mailbox. To do so, make sure your Agent is running. Then, click on the __Local Agent Inspector__ URL provided in your terminal output. You will be redirected towards the Inspector UI and will be able to see multiple details about this local Agent.

Here, click the __Connect__ button. 

![mailbox-connect](/img/uagents/mailbox-connect.png)

You will be presented with 3 different choices: Mailbox, Proxy and Custom. Select Mailbox.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/resources/img/uagents/mailbox-options.png" alt="tech-stack" style={{ width: '75%', maxWidth: '600px' }} />
</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/resources/img/uagents/mailbox-done.png" alt="tech-stack" style={{ width: '75%', maxWidth: '600px' }} />
</div>

You will then see some code details available for the Agent. You do not need to do anything, just click on Finish.

You can see the agent details in the local agents and can try connecting it with other Agentverse agents using the `on_message` handler.


<!-- ### Proxy Agents

Now do you remember, we cannot local agents with the Agentverse agents. If you want to so we can add proxy parameter. 

A Proxy serves as a bridge between your Agent and the Agentverse, allowing the Agent to publish interaction data without needing a Mailbox. This setup is particularly beneficial for Agents requiring continuous operation and visibility in the [Agentverse Marketplace](https://Agentverse.ai/).

Consider the following basic Agent with a proxy:

```py title="proxy_agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
 
class Message(Model):
    message: str
 
# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    name="alice",
    seed="your_agent_seed_phrase",
    proxy=True
)
 
# Display the agent's address
print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

Similar to what we did for [mailbox agents](#create-a-mailbox-in-Agentverse). Select Proxy agent instead of Mailbox and proxy will be setup for agent.
