# Agentverse Overview

The [__Agentverse__](https://agentverse.ai/) is a cloud-based platform for creating and hosting autonomous Agents without the hassle of managing infrastructure. It provides an integrated development environment (IDE) where you can write, edit, and run Agent code directly in your browser. The [__Agentverse__](https://agentverse.ai/) offers:

- **Continuous Uptime**: Once you deploy your Agent, it remains online and responsive—no manual restart or extra hosting steps needed.  
- **Easy Deployment**: Predefined templates and an in-browser editor help you get started quickly, regardless of your coding background.  
- **Blockchain Integration**: Agents have their own wallets for sending/receiving tokens, querying balances, and interacting with on-chain contracts.  
- **Marketplace & Discovery**: Hosted Agents are registered in the **Almanac**, making them discoverable by other Agents or users searching for specific functions.  
- **Mailroom Service**: Allows Agents to receive messages even when offline, retrieving them once they come back online.
