# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Fetch.ai Hackathon Repository

## Purpose

This repository exists to accelerate development and experimentation with agent-based systems using Fetch.ai technologies. It is designed as a collaborative workspace for hackathon participants to quickly prototype, test, and document autonomous agents and related tools.

## Problems Solved

- **Onboarding**: Lowers the barrier for new developers to get started with uAgents and Fetch.ai protocols.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Provides templates and examples for building, testing, and deploying agents.
- **Documentation**: Centralizes guides, references, and quick-start materials for both agents and the documentation site.
- **Experimentation**: Enables safe, modular experimentation with agent logic, communication, and integration patterns.

## High-Level Goals

- Provide a clear, well-documented starting point for agent development.
- Offer working agent examples (e.g., alert_agent, alert_tester_agent) to demonstrate best practices.
- Maintain a documentation site (MDX/Next.js style) for guides, references, and onboarding.
- Establish a “memory bank” to track project progress, lessons learned, and errors.
- Support ongoing improvements and extensions by maintaining a clear task backlog and active context.
